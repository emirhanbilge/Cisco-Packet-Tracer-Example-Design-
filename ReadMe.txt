Computer Network planning and design is an iterative process, including topological design,
network architectures, and network traffic characterization. Well-designed computer network
architecture should support maximum number of network users, traffic load with minimum delay,
and adequate hardware support for network expansions. However, the designer should keep the
balance between the cost of network hardware and the system requirements.
In this project, a metropolitan area network (MAN) design and simulation using Packet Tracer is
expected.

The network requirements and specifications are given below:

1. Metropolitan area network design includes two distinct branches office in a city, which
are connected by routers (at least two routers for each branch) over an ISP (Internet
Service Provider). You also should consider connection technologies between ISP and
branches.
2. First branchâ€™s network is comprised of 3 distinct facilities and each facility has different
units and requirements. All specification for the first branch office is as following:
a. First facility has 5 workstation (PC) users, 5 wireless users (laptop) and 5
smartphone users. These users browse web, send emails and transfer files by
using their devices.
b. Second facility has 10 workstation users who use Web and FTP. 5 of workstations
are used for VoIP conference events.
c. Third facility has a server farm including 3 Web servers, 2 FTP servers, 1 DHCP
server, 1 mail server and 1 domain name server (DNS).
3. Second branch includes 3 distinct facilities and each facility includes different units
and requirements.
a. First facility has 5 workstation users, 10 wireless users and 5 tablet users who
connect to the Internet using wireless connection, browse Web and use email
applications.
b. Second facility has 10 workstation users and 5 smartphone users. They use web
browsing, editing applications and transfer files.
c. Third facility has 10 workstations and 5 mobile devices that are used to browse Web,
send and receive emails.
Simulation Scenarios
Following activities should be simulated and analyzed within your model. You should test these
scenarios and explain them in detail in your report.

1- A wireless user from first facility of second branch wants to read emails and browse Web.

2- A computer engineer from second facility of second branch developed a web application

and wants to send her code files to FTP server in the third facility of first branch.

3- Two users from second facility of first branch want to talk via VoIP.

4- A user in the second facility of first branch wants to send an email message to his friend
in the second facility of second branch.

5- A user from first facility of second branch pings Web server of second facility of first
branch.

6- A laptop user from first facility of first branch office wants to send email to her friend in
the first facility of second branch office.

7- A smartphone user from third facility of second branch office wants to use ssh to connect
to a Web server in the third facility of first branch office.
